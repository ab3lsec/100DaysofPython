# 100DaysofPython

Welcome to my 100 Days of Python Challenge repository! This repository serves as a journal documenting my journey as I learn Python programming over the course of 100 days. Each day, I delve into a new topic, practice programming exercises, and potentially work on projects to reinforce my understanding.

## Motivation
I've embarked on this challenge to strengthen my Python skills and deepen my understanding of programming concepts. By dedicating time each day to learning and practicing Python, I aim to become proficient in the language and gain the confidence to tackle a variety of projects.

## Structure
- **Notes:** This directory contains my daily notes summarizing the key concepts I learned each day.
- **Practice Programs:** Here, you'll find the Python scripts I've written to practice the concepts covered in each day's lesson.
- **Projects:** As I progress through the challenge, I'll undertake various projects to apply what I've learned in real-world scenarios. You can find these projects documented in this directory.
