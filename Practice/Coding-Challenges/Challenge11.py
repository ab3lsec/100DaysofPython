# Write a Python function called reverse_tuple that takes a tuple as input 
# and returns a new tuple with its elements reversed.

# For example:

# original_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# reversed_tuple = reverse_tuple(original_tuple)
# print(reversed_tuple)  # Output should be: (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)

# Next, prompt the user to enter values for a tuple. Ask the user to enter the values separated by commas (e.g., 1,2,3) 
# and then convert these values into a tuple. Finally, call the reverse_tuple function with the user-provided tuple and print out the reversed tuple.

# This challenge will allow you to practice defining functions, working with tuples, 
# and performing tuple manipulation operations without directly inputting tuples.
